# DynamicDelaunayTriangulation
JS app that creates a delaunary triangulation graph with dynamic user input.
There are always two nodes, users can add and delete at whim

A Delaunay Triangulation graph is a triangulation in which all nodes are part of a triangulation, but no node is in two or more triangulations.

This is a summer project for fun.
